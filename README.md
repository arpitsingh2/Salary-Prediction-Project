# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project predicts an employee's **salary** based on their **years of experience** using **Linear Regression**.  
It demonstrates the steps of **data preparation, model training, prediction, and evaluation** in Python using `scikit-learn` and `pandas`.

## Dataset
- Features: 
  - `YearsExperience` (independent variable)
- Target:
  - `Salary` (dependent variable)
- The dataset is small and illustrative, used to demonstrate Linear Regression.

---

## Steps Performed
1. **Import Libraries**  
   - `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`

2. **Prepare Data**  
   - Split dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.

3. **Train Model**  
   - Fit a `LinearRegression` model on the training data.

4. **Prediction**  
   - Predict salary for new values of experience.

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Calculate `R²` and `Adjusted R²` to measure model performance.
